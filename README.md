# homekit-4-home-diy-collection
A collection of homekit enabled projects for your homekit DIY home.

This repo is intended primarily as a repository for my personal homekit related side projects, and second as a place others can come for ideas. 

I will attempt to ensure each projects CAD file, PCB Designs, circuit schematic are available within this repo.
At least at this stage I will not extensively document the contents, however as I refine aspects this may change.  

Happy Homekit-ing.
